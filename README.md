# Credit-Scoring-in-an-African-context
Access to credit is one of the key drivers of economic development, whether it is used to finance a business, a personal project, or an urgent need. But before granting a loan, a crucial question arises: will the client be able to repay it?

This is the central challenge of credit scoring, a task at the heart of modern banking systems. Thanks to data and artificial intelligence, financial institutions can now assess the risk of default with greater accuracy and fairness.

In Africa, where a large part of the population remains underbanked, developing efficient and locally adapted scoring models can promote sustainable financial inclusion.

To address this challenge, I'm designing a model that **predicts the risk of default** based on the credit histories of clients from a financial institution.
